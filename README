ColorsFromImage
===============

Find colors from an example image, which can be used to provide theme colors
matching an uploaded logo. 

Inspired by http://blog.dabbledb.com/2007/04/white--or-green.html

It uses RMagick / ImageMagick to find interesting colors from an image
based on saturation, luminance, and the histogram.

Installation
============

Rails 2.1:

./script/plugin install git://github.com/Fudge/colors_from_image.git

Rails 2.0.2:

cd vendor/plugins; git clone git://github.com/Fudge/colors_from_image.git

Example
=======

ColorsFromImage.get_colors('/path/to/logo.jpg') # => ["#020202", "#fb680d", "#dc8e53", "#9f643f"]

background, primary, secondary, tertiary = ColorsFromImage.get_colors('/path/to/logo.jpg')
text_color = ColorsFromImage.dark?(background) ? "#fff" : "#333"


The first result is the background color (nil if the image is transparent), and the following entries
are the interesting colors sorted by relevance.
